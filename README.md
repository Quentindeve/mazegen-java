# Maze generation in Java

This work is a part of the work I did in the [Universit√© de Lille]()'s project. The goal of this project was to create a game where the player could navigate within the maze to find the exit.

This repository implements 2 maze generation algorithms:

-   [Exhaustive Exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_implementation)
-   [Randomized Kruskal's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_Kruskal's_algorithm)

Note that they are naive implementations and are not suitable in a production environment.
